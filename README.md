# RESET

Template app that you can use to bootstrap your project.

Most common API backend functionality

Roadmap:
 - (done) Simple REST CRUD todo-list app
 - (done) Marshalling
 - (done) Jsonapi support 
 - (done) Access based on JWT
 - (done) Functional tests example
 - (done) Unit tests example
 - Async endpoints example
 - Kong or similar as a passport-proxy-app
 - Postponed calls with rabbitmq or redis and celery
 - Regular jobs, lambda-like functions
 - Environments: PROD, DEV 
 - Telemetry module, that will sends data to the some timeseries DB (for example InfluxDB or similar)
 - Statistics gathering with prometheus
 - Autogenerated grafana dashboard
 - GQL example app
 - More complex CRUD (REST and GQL) with relations and hierarchical-like data structure
 - Scalable, multi-cloud ready database
 - Hashicorp infrastructure for deployment to multi-cloud in the same time (aws+cgp+azure)
 - Vagrant support for simulating several 
 
 Goals of this repository is making a blueprint that can be used in every python web app.
 
 Main features, that should be in the final solution:
  - Easy bootstrap a new project
  - Ease supportable codebase
  - Modular architecture
  - Infrastructure as a code (devops minded approach)
  - Cloud first, but multi-tenant and multi-cloud support
  
   

HOW TO

======



#### Run app

```sh

docker-compose up --build

```



#### Run tests

After running the app

Run unit tests:
```sh

docker exec -it reset-app make ut

```

Run functional tests:
```sh

docker exec -it reset-app make ft

```


Currently the main focus is putted on the **functional** tests, not unit
